# Decision_Tree_Classifier_basic_example
This repository contains the basic example of decision tree.<br>
A decision tree is a flowchart-like structure in which each internal node represents a test on a feature, each leaf node represents a class label and branches represent conjunctions of features that lead to those class.<br>
Decision Tree is always used in the Recommendation System . Whenever you need to make a recommendation system always use Decision Tree.<br>
The Problem with Decision Tree is that it overfits the data ie. it works best for training the data while in case of testing it is not that much efficient.<br>
